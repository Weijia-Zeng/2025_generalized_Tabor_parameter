This is the set of computation and plotting codes used in our work submitted to *Proceedings of the Royal Society A* (doi:10.1098/rspa.2025.0932). All files are organized according to the order in which the figures are generated.

The project focuses on the pull-off force arising from adhesion between a suspended thin film and a rigid spherical indenter, and on how this force relates to various mechanical and geometric parameters in the model. We propose a Tabor-like control parameter for thin-film systems, analogous to the classical bulk models. The problem involves solving the Föppl–von Kármán equations with van der Waals forces as external loading, which we compute numerically using central differences and Newton’s method. We also provide the numerical datasets required for plotting, so readers can easily reproduce the figures shown in the paper.

Some figures include zoomed-in views, which require specific MATLAB toolbox "Image Processing Toolbox" as well as the two files `BaseZoom.m` and `parameters.json`. These files should be placed in the corresponding folders or in MATLAB’s working directory to ensure the main code can access them properly.
